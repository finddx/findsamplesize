\usage{
sample_size_non_inferiority(se1, se2, r, min_dif, alpha, power)
}
\arguments{
\item{se1}{Sensitivity/Specificity of the comparator test}

\item{se2}{Sensitivity/Specificity of the index test}

\item{r}{Correlation coefficient: 0 for an unpaired design, 0.5 for a paired design. Default = 0.5}

\item{min_dif}{Minimum non-acceptable difference}

\item{alpha}{Significance level}

\item{power}{Desired power}
}
\value{
Sample size
}
\description{
Gives the sample size for a diagnostic accuracy non-inferiority trial, based on estimated accuracy for each test and a minimum non-acceptable difference (Eq. 6.24 from Zhou et al. 2011)  Variance is calculated using the Eq.6.21 from Zhou et al., which was originally published in Blume et al. 2009.
