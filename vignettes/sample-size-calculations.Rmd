### Sample size calculation  

Calculates the  sample size to estimate the accuracy of a single diagnostic test, and generates a power table based on Zhou et al.
Calculates sample size in terms of true positives/ true negatives based on the parameters entered.
When prevalence and prevalence power are not entered the function gives the number of true positives/negatives. When they are entered, it gives the total number of subjects to be screened.


```{r examples-sample_size_calculation}
 sample_size_calculation(sen_spe= 0.8, alpha=0.05, power=0.8, margin=0.05, prevalence = NULL, prevalence_power = NULL, performance_characteristic = "sen") 
# Number of true positives for a sensitivity of 80%

 sample_size_calculation(sen_spe= 0.8, alpha=0.05, power=0.8, margin=0.05, prevalence = 0.1, prevalence_power = 0.9, performance_characteristic = "sen") 
 # Total  number of patients to be screened to test 80% sensitivity with 10% prevalence and 80% prevalence power


```

### Total N Calculation: 

 Calculates the total number of subjects to be screened to estimate the accuracy of a single diagnostic test, based on a known number of confirmed positives/negatives that is needed, an estimate of prevalence, and prevalence power.


```{r examples-n_tot_calculation}

 n_tot_calculation(sample_size=503, prevalence = 0.1, prevalence_power = 0.9) 
# Total  number of patients to be screened to test 80% sensitivity with 10% prevalence and 80% prevalence power. 
# Should give the same number as the second example of sample_size_calculation

```

### Error margin Calculation  

Calculates the margin of error for one side based on the significance, power, sensitivity/specificity, and the number true positives/negatives, to estimate the accuracy of a single diagnostic test.




```{r examples-margin_calc}

 margin_calc(alpha=0.05, power=0.8, sen_spe=0.8, sample_size=502) 
# Error margin on one side. Using the same parameters as sample_size_calculation. Should be ~0.05

```

### Calculate Power  

Calculate the power of the design based on sample size, error margin, sensitivity/specificity and significance level, for the estimation of the accuracy of a single diagnostic test.


```{r examples-power_calc}

 power_calc(alpha=0.05, margin=0.05, sen_spe=0.8, sample_size=502) 
# Power of the study. Using the same parameters as sample_size_calculation. Should be ~80%

```

## gen_pow_curve

Generates a table with sample size (confirmed cases and to be screened) calculated for a sequence of desired powers using the "sample_size_calculation" function.
    

  

```{r example-gen_pow_curve}
pow_list <- c(0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95)
    dt <- gen_pow_curve(seq = pow_list,
                        sen_spe = 0.9,
                        alpha = 0.05,
                        margin = 0.05,
                        prevalence = 0.4,
                        prevalence_power = 0.8 ,
                        performance_characteristic = "sen")
```

  

  




### Sample Size for proportion estimation

Calculate the sample size necessary to estimate a proportion in a finite or infinite proportion. (Daniel et. al)



```{r examples-sample_size_pop_prop}

 n_pop_prop(alpha = 0.05, p =  0.5, margin = 0.1, N = 1000) 

# sample size for a population of 1000 people to estimate that at least half of the population has the desired characteristic with an error margin of 10%

 n_pop_prop(alpha = 0.05, p =  0.5, margin = 0.1) 
 # same calculation in an infinite population
```

### Sample Size for cluster randomized trials

Calculates the number of clusters necessary for a cluster randomized trials, based on an estimated change in the proportions between the control and intervention groups.
    

  

```{r example-cluster_random_sample_size}

# The matched trial protocol required 80% power of detecting a 50% reduction of annual HIV incidence from an assumed 1% in the control arm (π0 = 0.02 over 2 years) to 0.5% in the intervention arm (π1 = 0.01). Thus, with m = 1000 adults followed up in each cluster, the number of clusters required per treatment arm in a matched design was gives 6.8 = 7 cluster pairs
cluster_random_sample_size(alpha=0.05, power=0.8, coef_var=0.25, A =2, pi=0.01, pc=0.02, CS=1000)
```

  

  



### Effective Sample Size

The effective sample size (ESS) accounts for the clustering structure in clustered data and provides an estimate of the sample size needed to achieve the same level of precision as a simple random sample of the same size.

E.g., if you have 4 physicians’ offices enrolling 32 patients each, you have 128 subjects in your study. Depending on the intracluster correlation coefficient and the design effect, however, you may effectively have far fewer subjects enrolled in your trial from a statistical perspective i.e., the effective sample size.


```{r example-effective_sample_size}

# In a cluster randomized controlled trial, you have 8 clusters with 30 participants per cluster i.e., total sample size of 240 and an ICC of 0.2. A simple method to calculate the power associated with this sample size is to first calculate the effective sample size i.e., the sample size in a simple random sample that would give the same level of precision, and then do a power calculation using the ESS. 

effective_sample_size(m = 30, k =8, ICC = 0.2)

```

## Compare proportions in a 2 sample cross-over design

    

  

```{r example-compare_proportions_cross}
# Difference between the two proportions are predicted to be 10%
compare_proportions_cross(alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, p_diff = 0.1, var = 0.5)
```

  

  

# sample_size_non_inferiority

    

  
  

# ss_non_inf_2

    

  

```{r example-ss_non_inf_2}
#' \dontrun{
ss_non_inf_2(theta_s = 0.45, theta_e = 0.43, delta_m = 0.07, beta = 0.8)
ss_non_inf_2(theta_s = 0.45, theta_e = 0.43, delta_m = 0.07, beta = 0.8, p11 = 0.5)
#' }
```

  

  
  

```{r example-sample_size_non_inferiority}
sample_size_non_inferiority(se1 = 0.9, se2 = 0.88, r = 0.5, min_dif=0.05, alpha=0.05, power=0.8)
```
